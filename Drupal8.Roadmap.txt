Drupal 8 automates allows for more fluid changes of site configuration, but
there is still a need to make controlled changes as part of a release and get
feedback on them as part of the release.

The good news is, Drupal 8's implementation of hook_update_N() is pretty much
unchanged, so it will just be a matter of getting each method to speak D8.
In cases where D8 methods exist that make a hook_update_deploy_tools method
obsolete, it will be removed.
